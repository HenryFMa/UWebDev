# UWebDev

Unifying and Simplifying the Web Development.

# Thinking

* Language for programming is converging via learning from each others, regarding the web, it should/would be the ECMAScript a.k.a JavaScript with the server-side extension of NodeJS.
* Environments a.k.a platforms are unifying as well:
* * Web browsers have been supporting ECMAScript more and more consistently.
* * NodeJS has extended the web programming langusage to the backend, and going more and more popular.
* * Cordova/Crosswalk has been covering the mobile natives.
* Internet should and would be evolving from information-centric world to people-centric world.
* * WebRTC for realtime communication, and WebGL/ThreeJS enabling 3D could possibly be the cornerstones.
* The whole community/ecosystem is extremely active, which is a sign of thriving, though seemingly a bit messy.

# Inspiration

A systematic solution of the building blocks for simplifying engineering deserves to be putting into existence!!!
